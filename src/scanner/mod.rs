This module defines various scanners that can be used to extract values from input text.

## Kinds of Scanner

Scanners can be classified as "static self scanners", "static abstract scanners", and "runtime abstract scanners".

* "Static self scanners" are types which implement the `ScanFromStr` trait and output an instance of themselves.  For example, if you scan using the `i32` type, you get an `i32` result.  These are implemented for types which have an obvious "default" scanning syntax.

  As a consequence of outputting an instance of themselves, they *also* automatically implement the `ScanSelfFromStr` trait.

* "Static abstract scanners" are types which implement the `ScanFromStr` trait and output an instance of *some other* type.  For example, if you scan using the `Word` type, you get a `&str` or `String` result.  These are implemented for cases where different rules are desireable, such as scanning particular *subsets* of a type (see `Word`, `Number`, `NonSpace`), or non-default encodings (see `Binary`, `Octal`, `Hex`).

* "Runtime abstract scanners" implement the `ScanStr` trait and serve the same overall function as static abstract scanners, except that the scanner *itself* must be constructed.  In other words, static scanners are types, runtime scanners are *values*.  This makes them a little less straightforward to use, but they are *significantly* more flexible.  They can be parameterised at runtime, to perform arbitrary manipulations of both the text input and scanned values (see `max_width`, `re_str`).

## Bridging Between Static and Runtime Scanners

A scanner of interest is `ScanA<Type>`.  This is a runtime scanner which takes a *static* scanner as a type parameter.  This allows you to use a static scanner in a context where a runtime scanner is needed.

For example, these two bindings are equivalent in terms of behaviour:

```ignore
    // Scan a u32.
    let _: u32
    let _ <| scan_a::<u32>()
```

## Creating Runtime Scanners

Runtime scanners are typically constructed using functions, rather than dealing with the implementing type itself.  For example, to get an instance of the `ExactWidth` runtime scanner, you would call either the `exact_width` or `exact_width_a` functions.

The reason for two functions is that most runtime scanners accept a *second* runtime scanner for the purposes of chaining.  This allows several transformations to be applied outside-in.  For example, you can combine runtime scanners together like so:

```ignore
    // Scan a word of between 2 and 5 bytes.
    let _ <| min_width(2, max_width(5, scan_a::<Word>()))
```

Functions ending in `_a` are a shorthand for the common case of wrapping a runtime scanner around a static scanner.  For example, the following two patterns are equivalent:

```ignore
    // Scan a u32 that has, at most, four digits.
    let _ <| max_width(4, scan_a::<u32>())
    let _ <| max_width_a::<u32>(4)
```

It is also where implementations for existing standard and external types are kept, though these do not appear in the documentation.

/**
This trait defines the interface to a type which can be scanned.

The exact syntax scanned is entirely arbitrary, though there are some rules of thumb that implementations should *generally* stick to:

* Do not ignore leading whitespace.
* Do not eagerly consume trailing whitespace, unless it is legitimately part of the scanned syntax.

In addition, if you are implementing scanning directly for the result type (*i.e.* `Output = Self`), prefer parsing *only* the result of the type's `Debug` implementation.  This ensures that there is a degree of round-tripping between `format!` and `scan!`.

If a type has multiple legitimate parsing forms, consider defining those alternate forms on abstract scanner types (*i.e.* `Output != Self`) instead.
