/**
This trait defines the interface to a type which can be scanned.

The exact syntax scanned is entirely arbitrary, though there are some rules of thumb that implementations should *generally* stick to:

* Do not ignore leading whitespace.
* Do not eagerly consume trailing whitespace, unless it is legitimately part of the scanned syntax.

In addition, if you are implementing scanning directly for the result type (*i.e.* `Output = Self`), prefer parsing *only* the result of the type's `Debug` implementation.  This ensures that there is a degree of round-tripping between `format!` and `scan!`.

If a type has multiple legitimate parsing forms, consider defining those alternate forms on abstract scanner types (*i.e.* `Output != Self`) instead.

See: [`ScanSelfFromStr`](trait.ScanSelfFromStr.html).
